In the first task  Check if a Number is Even or Odd,
the user reads an integer value with the help of input function
By using the if condition and n % 2==0 to check wheather the given number is even or odd
if the condition is true the the given number is even otherwise the given number is false.


In the second task  Sum of Integers from 1 to 50 Using a Loop
In this task let us consider a variable sum and intialize the vaue to zero
by using for loop of range 1 to 51 only because the last number will not include and the loop performs the repeatedly until the condition is false
and if the condition is false the controller terminates the out of the loop.
